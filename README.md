**Study Subscription Platform**

This Java-based application serves as a subscription management platform for educational courses across various domains such as Programming Languages, Web Development, Aptitude, and Data Structures. The system is designed to help users enroll in courses offered through different platforms with customizable learning modes. Users can select from multiple learning options such as Live Classes, Video Lectures, and Mock Tests, each with a limited number of seats available.

The key features of this system include:
- **Course and Mode Selection**: Users can select from a variety of courses and sub-courses based on their interest, along with the learning mode that best fits their needs.
- **Seat Management**: The system keeps track of seat availability for each mode (Live Classes, Video Lectures, Mock Tests), ensuring that users are notified when a mode is fully booked.
- **Pricing Calculation**: The application calculates the total cost of the subscription based on the selected course, mode, and time period (6 Months or 1 Year). It also applies available coupons to provide discounts on the total price.
- **Enrollment Records**: User enrollment details, including course choices, pricing, and discounts, are recorded in a structured format and saved to a text file. This ensures users can keep a detailed record of their selections.
- **Existing Enrollment Management**: The system reads from a file to track existing enrollments, adjusting seat availability accordingly when a user chooses a course.

This project demonstrates the use of Java in handling real-world application logic such as course management, pricing calculation, and file input/output. Itâ€™s a practical solution for anyone interested in learning how to implement subscription systems, seat management, and dynamic pricing in Java. The command-line interface ensures simplicity and ease of interaction, making it user-friendly for educational purposes.
